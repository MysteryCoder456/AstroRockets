# AstroRockets (In Development)

Welcome to AstroRockets. It is a remade version of my favourite iPad game Astro Duel. I am still not very good at coding so please do not hate on me if I make some rookie mistakes.

## System Requirements

  1. Processors: Intel Atom® processor or Intel® Core™ i3 processor.
  2. Disk Space: 2 GB or more.
  3. Operating systems: Windows 7 or later, macOS, and Linux.
  4. Display Size: at least 720p.

## Installation

To install this game follow these steps:

  1. Install the Python 3 Interpreter from <https://www.python.org/>.
  2. Go to Command Prompt/Terminal on your computer and enter "pip install pygame".
  3. Then go to the folder you want to install it in using Command Prompt/Terminal, and enter `git clone https://github.com/MysteryCoder456/AstroRockets.git` or download a zip of the project.

**If you get any errors please tell me in the Issues tab.**

## Running the Game

Open the game folder in Terminal and enter `sh start_unix.sh`.

## How to play

**The controls are simple:** WASD and L-Shift for player 1 and arrow keys and R-Shift for player 2.

## Issues

If you encounter any bugs or issues with the game please tell me. I will be more than happy to listen.
